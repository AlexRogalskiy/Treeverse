        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>After installing Treeverse for your browser, open Twitter and click on the tweet that you would like to
        visualize the conversation of (or try <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/977652162137395201">this one</a>.)</p>

        <p></p>If you’re using Chrome, the icon for Treeverse should turn from grey to blue in your browser. Click it to enter Treeverse.</p>

        <p>If you're using Firefox, the icon will be hidden until you open a tweet, and then it will appear in the address bar.</p>

        <h3>Exploring the Conversation</h3>
        <img alt="Screenshot of Treeverse" src="images/treeverse640.gif" style="width: 320; height: 150;"/>

        <p>Conversations are visualized as a tree. Each box is an individual tweet, and
        an line between two boxes indicates that the lower one is a reply to the upper
        one. The color of the line indicates the time duration between the two tweets
        (red is faster, blue is slower.)</p>
        
        <p>As you hover over nodes, the reply-chain preceeding that tweet appears on the right-side
        pane. By clicking a node, you can freeze the UI on that tweet in order to interact with
        the right-side pane. By clicking anywhere in the tree window, you can un-freeze the tweet
        and return to the normal hover behavior.</p>

        <p>Some tweets will appear with a red circle with white ellipses inside them, either overlayed
        on them or as a separate node. This means that
        there are more replies to that tweet that haven't been loaded. Double-clicking a node will
        load additional replies to that tweet.</p>

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        
        <p>Treeverse runs entirely in your browser. No data is collected or tracked by Treeverse directly
        when you install it or explore a tree. The extension only communicates with the Treeverse server
        if you click the “Create sharable link” button, in which case the current tree
        to be sent to a server so that it can be made available to others. Access to the shared link server
        may be tracked to prevent abuse.</p>
        
        <p>Browser extension installs may be tracked by Google and Mozilla, and the data
        requests made to Twitter may be tracked by Twitter. Additionally, when Treeverse runs it loads a
        font hosted by Google Fonts. Google may track this download.</p>
